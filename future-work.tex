\chapter{Future Work}

Projects such as this are a continuous process. We had planned a lot more things to do but due to limitations of time and resources we couldn't do everything. The following is a list of other things that could be done in the future:
\begin{itemize}
\item A similar awareness survey for the faculty of different departments of the institute.
\item With the support of FOSSCell, paste posters in the campus comparing FOSS and proprietary software categorizing them according to the different departments so as to promote use of alternate (freedom) software and reduce dependence on proprietary solutions, ultimately leading to lesser tendency of students to make illegal copies of software.
\item Develop an online portal for the same purpose as listed in the last point.
\item Continue organizing small-level sessions like Drupal for freshers and others interested to make them aware and skilful in this arena.
\end{itemize}
