Nobody seems to care about ethics of software these days. Everywhere we know people using illegal copies of software, or even distributing them without knowing if they are legally or ethically right to do so. Being moulded into Professionals in the course of engineering education, there is a need to be aware about the ethics related to software. In this report we explore what Software Ethics are about, analyze the Software Ethics Awareness level among the students of the NITC campus, present some ways we used to improve the situation for the better throughout the time we worked on this project and list what else could be done.
