We would like to express our deep sense of gratitude to {\bf Mr.\ A.\ Rajagopalan} for his invaluable help and guidance during the course of this project.

Thanks are also due to all those people whom we worked with --- members of FOSSCell, freshers, participants of the Software Ethics Survey both online and offline.

And a special thanks to the people behind this great document preparation system --- \LaTeX, which helped us create this report in such a professional way.
